    abstract = {The primary interactions of low-energy x-rays within condensed matter, viz. photoabsorption and coherent scattering, have been described for photon energies outside the absorption threshold regions by using atomic scattering factors. The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.}

    abstract = "{The photon energy dependence of the mean energy W required to produce an electron-hole pair in silicon for photons with energies between 50 and 1500 eV was determined from the spectral responsivity of selected silicon photodiodes. The spectral responsivity was measured with a relative uncertainty of less than 0.3\\% using monochromatized synchrotron radiation whose radiant power was measured with a cryogenic electrical substitution radiometer. In order to deduce W from the spectral responsivity of photodiodes with a relative uncertainty of about 1\\%, a method for the calculation of photon and electron escape losses from silicon photodiodes was developed and the model for the charge carrier recombination losses was improved. In contrast to recent theoretical and experimental results, a constant value W=(3.66±0.03) eV was obtained in the photon energy range from 50 to 1500 eV. The present experimental results are confirmed by calculation of the pair creation energy in silicon from data from the literature for the relevant material properties. The difference from previous theoretical work is due to different assumptions about the influence of the band structure of silicon.}",
