In this work, we will model the light-sensitive region of the backilluminated 
\CCD\ sensor as a epitaxial silicon layer with a thickness $D$, which is coated
with a thin oxide layer of thickness $\delta$ to provide a realistic transmission 
coefficent.
The illuminated side of the epitaxial layer is considered to be implanted with ions
up to a depth $W$ to create the electric field within the sensor."""

The \QE\ is a common performance metric for measuring \CCD\ sensitivity and is
\begin{equation} \label{quantum-efficiency}
    \text{QE}(\lambda) = \frac{N_{e}}{N_\gamma}
                       = T(\lambda) \times \text{IQY}(\lambda) \times \text{CCE}(\lambda),
\end{equation}
where $N_e(\lambda)$ is the number of electrons measured by the sensor for a 
given wavelength $\lambda$,
$N_\gamma$ is the total number of photons incident on the sensor,
$T(\lambda)$ is the transmissivity of the vacuum/SiO$_2$/Si interface , 
$\text{IQY}(\lambda)$ is the ideal \QY, the number of photoelectrons generated 
per absorbed photon,
and $\text{CCE}(\lambda)$ is the charge-collection efficiency, the fraction of 
photoelectrons measured by the sensor.

$T(\lambda)$ can be determined from the optical constants, using, for example, the IMD code \citep{Windt1998}.
For this work, we used our software, \texttt{optika} \citep{optika}, 
which has a convenient Python interface and uses
the transfer matrix method described in \citet{Yeh1988} with the optical constants
from \citet{Palik1997} and \cite{Henke1993}.

The ideal \QY\ is given by \citet{Janesick2001} as
\begin{equation}
    \text{IQY}(\lambda) = \begin{cases}
        0, & 0 < \epsilon < E_\text{g} \\
        1, & E_\text{g} < \epsilon < E_\text{eh} \\
        E_\text{eh} / \epsilon, & E_\text{eh} < \epsilon < \infty,
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon$ is the energy of an incident photon, 
$E_\text{g} = \bandgapEnergy$ is the bandgap energy of silicon,
and $E_\text{eh} = \electronHoleEnergy$ is the energy required to generate one
electron-hole pair at room temperature.

In \citet{Stern1994}, the \CCE\ is expressed in terms of differential \CCE,
$\eta(z)$, which is the fraction of photoelectrons collected for a photon 
absorbed at a depth $z$ into the epitaxial layer.
The total \CCE\ is then the average differential \CCE\ weighted by 
the probability of absorbing a photon at a depth $z$,
\begin{equation} \label{cce}
    \text{CCE}(\lambda) = \frac{\int_0^\infty \eta(z) \exp(-\alpha z) \, dz}
                               {\int_0^\infty \exp(-\alpha z) \, dz},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient of silicon for the given wavelength.

In principle, $\eta(z)$ is a function of the exact implant profile which is
usually impractical to measure, but see \cite{Stern2004} for a case where the
authors did have a measurement of the exact implant profile.
In \citet{Stern1994}, the authors instead adopt a piecewise-linear approximation of
the differential \CCE,
\begin{equation} \label{differential-cce}
    \eta(z) = \begin{cases}
        \eta_0 + (1 - \eta_0) z / W, & 0 < z < W \\
        1, & W < z < D \\
        0, & D < z < \infty
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\eta_0$ is the differential \CCE\ at the back surface of the sensor.
Plugging Equation \ref{differential-cce} into Equation \ref{cce} yields an
arithmetic expression for the \CCE,
\begin{equation}
    \text{CCE}(\lambda) = \eta_0 + \left( \frac{1 - \eta_0}{\alpha W} \right)(1 - e^{-\alpha W}) - e^{-\alpha D},
\end{equation}
which can be used in Equation \ref{quantum-efficiency} to determine the \QE.

In \citet{Stern1994}, the authors define an effective \QE\ as
\begin{equation} \label{eqe}
    \text{EQE}(\lambda) = T(\lambda) \times \text{CCE}(\lambda),
\end{equation}
which is the quantity that is typically measured when calibrating a \CCD\ sensor
\citep{Stern1994,Stern2004,Boerner2012}.
In Figure \ref{fig:eqe}, we've plotted the measured, effective \QE\ of the
\AIA\ \CCDs, and a fit of Equation \ref{eqe} to the data, which varied $\eta_0$,
$\delta$, and $W$, while holding $D$ constant.
We will use these fit parameters in the remainder of this article as a representative
example.

Ultraviolet solar astronomy is often shot-noise limited \citep{Lemen2012, DePontieu2014}.
The shot noise measured by the \CCD\ is described by a Poisson distribution with 
variance, $N_{\gamma,\text{m}}$, the number of photons measured by the sensor 
(photons which are associated with at least one measured photoelectron).
        
$N_{\gamma,\text{m}}$ can be expressed as a product of
the transmissivity of the sensor's back surface,
the probability that at least one electron will be measured by the sensor, 
$P_\text{m}(\lambda)$,
and the total number of incident photons, $N_\gamma$:
\begin{equation}
    N_{\gamma,\text{m}} = T(\lambda) P_\text{m}(\lambda) N_\gamma.
\end{equation}
The fraction of photons which result in photoelectrons that completely recombine
before being measured, $P_\text{r}(\lambda) = 1 - P_\text{m}(\lambda)$,
is given by a binomial distribution and simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
    P_\text{r}(\lambda) = \left[ 1 - \text{CCE}(\lambda) \right]^{\text{IQY}(\lambda)}.
\end{equation}

An example calculation of $P_\text{m}(\lambda)$ for the \AIA\ sensors is plotted 
in Figure~\ref{fig:probability}.
For short (visible) wavelengths,
$P_\text{m}(\lambda) \approx \text{CCE}(\lambda)$
since the ideal \QY\ is unity, and for long (X-ray) wavelengths, 
$P_\text{m}(\lambda) \approx 1$ since the ideal \QY\ is large.
However, in ultraviolet wavelengths, $P_\text{m}(\lambda)$ is more complicated
and smoothly connects these two extremes.

The Fano noise for silicon is commonly accepted to have a Fano factor of about 0.1.
This is usually measured with X-rays from $^{55}$Fe sources which have a high \QY.

to construct a distribution narrow enough to be consistent with a Fano factor 
that small.
